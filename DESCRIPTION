Title: Latent Variable Model to Infer Food Intake from Multiple Biomarkers
Description: A latent variable model based on factor analytic and mixture of experts models, designed to infer food intake from multiple biomarkers data. The model is framed within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, which provides flexibility to adapt to different biomarker distributions and facilitates prediction of the intake along with its associated uncertainty. Details are in D'Angelo, et al. (2020) <arXiv:2006.02995>.
